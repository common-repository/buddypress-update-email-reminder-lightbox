BuddyPress Update Email Reminder Lightbox asks users to confirm their email address if they haven’t logged in for a while.

== Description ==

BuddyPress Update Email Reminder Lightbox asks users to confirm their email address if they haven’t logged in for a while.

For example, a user who hasn’t logged into her BuddyPress community in the last 100 days, will receive a lightbox alert asking her to verify that her email address is still correct.

You’ve seen similar functionality on Facebook, gmail, LinkedIn, etc.

This is a community management tool that helps your users to keep their profiles up-to-date.
